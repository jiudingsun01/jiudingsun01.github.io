I am a 4th year undergraduate student at Northeastern University in the [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) with a major in mathematics and computer science. I work on NLP/ML/DM. I studied at Tsinghua University in my sophomore year and worked with professor [Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) on Semantic Parsing and Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). I am currently working with professor [Wallace Byron](https://www.byronwallace.com/) and professor [David Bau](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/david-bau/) on instruction-following LLMs and interpretability. I am also a professionoal photographer, guitarist, and bar-tender.
