I am a junior undergraduate student at Northeastern University in the [Khoury College of Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) with a major in mathematics and computer science. I work on NLP/ML/DM. I studied at Tsinghua University in my sophomore year and worked with professor [Juanzi Li](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/persons/ljz/) on Semantic Parsing and Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA). I am now working with professor [Wallace Byron](https://www.byronwallace.com/) on instruction fine-tuning and summarization factuality.

Doctoral Plan
======

I intend to graduate from college on Spring 2024 and start pursuing a doctoral program at Fall 2024. I am humbly awaiting for any opportunities in the related fields. Here I listed a few facts about me for you to see if I am a good fit for your research group:

1. I really love NLP so I tend to spend much time on reserach. 
2. Instead of solving a problem at its level, I would like to dive a level deeper to provide a more fundamental and general improvement.
3. I think AI4Science has a great potential and would very much like to explore more of that
4. Code Generation is fun and useful!
5. Under the current paradigm, my preference for NLP research is: analysis > resrouce > methodology
